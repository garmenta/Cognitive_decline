BACKGROUND 

By 2050, it is projected that individuals aged 60 and older will constitute 25% of Mexico's population, a demographic shift that is expected to lead to an increase in dementia cases within the country. However, research studies suggest that up to 40% of dementia cases could be either avoided or delayed. Therefore highlighting the importance of analysis focus on this topic. 

METHODS

Cognitive decline is our output variable of interest. It is a categorical variable that was assigned class labels 0 to 3, where 0 indicates normal decline and 3 indicates dementia.  

There is some cognitive decline that is a normal part of aging. Cognitive impairment is not a normal part of aging and falls in the middle between the normal cognitive decline and dementia. Dementia is the most serious decline that is not normal of the aging process. 

This analysis used pooled longitudinal data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study for years 2012, 2015, and 2018. Only features that were available across years were included in the analysis. Descriptive statistics and visualizations were all conducted in python using libraries including but not limited to NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

LIST OF FEATURES

This analysis uses 143 demographic, economic, health-related, social, behavorial, psychological and mental features directly obtained or engineered from the MHAS.
